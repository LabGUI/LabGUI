the inline configuration file argument parsing doesn't seem to work well

the output console doesn't seem to work with python2

the instruments seem to not work in debug mode for python3, the dice output only 0's

the fonction file_load_settings in LabGuiMain uses create_action function from QtTools module and it seems with PYQT5 it emits a boolean which take the spot of the argument "fname"
